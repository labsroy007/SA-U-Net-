# SA U-Net++

This repository stores the code and resources for our research work on Self-Attention based U-Net++.

In this research, we have worked on proposing a novel Deep Learning solution, named SA U-Net++, for four environmental challenges: Solar Panel Segmentation, Solar Panel Defect Identification, Flood Segmentation and Oil Spill Segmentation.

- Solar Panel Segmentation dataset: https://zenodo.org/records/5171712#.YzQvutJBw_B
  
- Solar Panel Defect Identification dataset: https://miad-2022.github.io/
  
- Flood Segmentation Dataset: https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0
  
- Oil Spill Segmentation Dataset: https://m4d.iti.gr/oil-spill-detection-dataset/

The input to our model is a 4D array, containing 3-channel RGB images.

The repository contains the following folders:

- Dataset: Contains code for creating and preprocessing the dataset

- Models: Contains the code for the proposed SA U-Net++ model
  
- Testing: Contains functionalities for testing the performance of the models
