# SA-UNetpp

This repository stores the code and resources for our research work on Self-Attention based U-Net++.

In this research, we have worked on proposing a novel Deep Learning based solution, named SA U-Net++, for four environmental challenges: Solar Panel Segmentation, Solar Panel Defect Identification, Flood Segmentation and Oil Spill Segmentation.
